This is a fork of DSLogic program from DreamSource Lab whose intention
is to port the application to Mac OS X.

Currently the code compiles and the application starts. As I do not
have a DSLogic board available (yet, it will be coming through the
Kickstarter campaign) there is absolutely no guarantee that this is
functional.

sigrok dependencies were installed through Homebrew (http://brew.sh)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSLogic is an open source multi-function instrument for everyone.
DSLogic software is based on sigrok project.
You can find DSLogic on:
www.dreamsourcelab.com
www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamsourcelab/dslogic-multifunction-instruments-for-everyone

The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

Status
------

DSLogic software is in a usable state and has had official tarball releases.

However, it is still work in progress. Some basic functionality
is available and working, but other things are still on the TODO list.
